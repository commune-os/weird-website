The way to do that is a personal website [why? Links1,2,3]

For a lot of us, the “simple” prospect of filling in that web page with content presents an insurmountable writer’s block.

Thankfully, Wikipedia’s Irene Clark offers plenty of coping strategies, one of which we’re going all-in on:

Making lists!!! [three exclamation points make a vertical list icon; maybe we can play with that graphic]

Since we’re on the interwebs, the best things to list are web-links.

..like your existing web identities

- mastodon 🦣
- github :octocat:
- matrix 💬

(in which case we can import your personal contents from there and simply use that as your personal web page for now)

..or it could just be your three favorite movies

- Toy Story 🤠
- Twilight 🧛
- Titanic 🚢

Whatever you’ve listed, you’ve done it! You told us something about yourself. Now, not only are you taking up a bit of space on the web, as you should. You’ve also got your very own web-passport 🪪
