Each markdown "paragraph" will be a "marquee" message
They all display one after another horizontally

For now we just want to use paragraphs here and avoid stuff like
headings, links and so on even though they're supported. A link that's hard to click (because it moves) is bad UX

Say hello, again, to the weird web

Village-scale software 🏘️ 

Like itch.io, but for any Open Web project 

Like a distributed Wikipedia for projects

Like the internet archive for - you guessed it - projects 💫

A social network for your thoughts

An ecosystem for living ideas 🌱
