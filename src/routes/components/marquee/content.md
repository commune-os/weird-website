Each markdown "paragraph" will be a "marquee" message
They all display one after another horizontally

For now we just want to use paragraphs here and avoid stuff like
headings, links and so on even though they're supported. A link that's hard to click (because it moves) is bad UX

Say hello, again, to the weird web.

You are using village-scale software 🏘️ 

Like itch.io, but for any Open Web project 

Like distributed Wikipedia for projects.

Like internet archive for - you guessed it - projects.

A social network for living ideas; en ecosystem for thoughts
