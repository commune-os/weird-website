### Intro to Project Weird

"Agentic Developers' are the infrastructure-minded partners of 'Barefoot Developers'. 

Agentic development is happening when we build products based on the principles of local-first and end-to-end (p2p) combined, maximizing for user agency by way of user-centric design.

Weird is an open software product that's trying to solve for agency in the digital space. Built with the 'IPFS system' Iroh, Weird introduces a meta-protocol designed to de-fragment digital identity.

Guided by real-world use cases, we'll talk about the formative tenets of agentic product development.
